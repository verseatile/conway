a 2KB finite state machine written in Go

>I mean the plan is simple...store some state, swap them out and do whatever with them. Can only go up from here

### Goals
As of now, primary goals are the following:
* a state machine flexible enough for several scenarios (parsers, games, etc.)
* flexibility, ready to be dropped into any Go project
